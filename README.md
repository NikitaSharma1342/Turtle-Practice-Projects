# Description

All the three projects are created with the help of **library _turtle_ and module _random_**. In these projects the color pallete is used from the website [Trinket](https://trinket.io/docs/colors) which has interactive color palettes where the user can select any color of their choice and can copy and paste into maybe a list.

# Random Walk

Its basically the turtle making random movements North, East, South, or West, each time it progresses by the same distance, but it can at any point choose which direction it wants to go out of the four. Moreover, each time it walks, it's going to pick a different color.

This random walk is something that's used often in mathematics and other disciplines. Therefore it can be used to model various real life situations.
For example the financial status of a gambler or things like the path of a molecule in a liquid or gas or the search path of a foraging animal, and a whole bunch of other things. To refer for more applications [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) to this wikipedia article.

# Spirograph

In this we got our turtle to draw a number of circles each with a radius of a hundred in distance with the use random colors.

# Hirst - Painting

Its a million dollar painting by Damien Hirst, which sold for 1.275 million pounds a little while ago. And by using Python turtle we have created a similarly beautiful dot spot painting, which could be randomized and create beautiful piece of art.
